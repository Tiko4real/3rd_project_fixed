## How to Play

In this implementation of Battleship, you will play against the computer. The game starts with you placing your ship on a 5x5 grid. After placing your ship, you take turns with the computer to guess the locations of each other's ships. The game ends when one player's ship is completely sunk.

## Testing 

The game was manually tested extensively using Codeanywhere terminal.

### Manual Testing

The game was tested through various scenarios to ensure correct functionality. Testing included checking for correct ship placement, valid guesses, and correct hit/miss tracking.

| Feature | Expected Result | Steps Taken | Actual Result |
| ------- | -------------- | ----------- | ------------- |
| Intro Screen   | To display welcome message and prompt to start the game | None | As Expected |
| Ship Placement | To manually place the player's ship and randomly place the computer's ship | Followed prompts for manual placement | As Expected |
| Player's Turn   | Prompt to guess and check if hit or miss | Entered valid coordinates | As Expected |
| Computer's Turn | Computer makes a guess and result displayed | Wait for computer's guess | As Expected |
| Game Over   | Display win or lose message and prompt to play again | Played until game ended | As Expected |

### Input Validation Testing

* Ship placement
    * Ensured ship is placed within grid boundaries.
    * Ensured ship does not overlap with other ships.

* Guess input
    * Ensured guesses are within grid boundaries.
    * Checked for already guessed positions.
